# Intro

<<<<<<< HEAD
So I just want to say a few things for the people who are super new to binary exploitation / reverse engineering. If you are already familiar with assembly code / binary exploitation and reverse engineering, and tools like ghidra / pwntools / gdb, feel free to skip this whole section (and any other content you already know). The purpose of this section is to give sort of an introduction to the super new people.

## Binary Exploitation

First off what's a binary?

<<<<<<< HEAD
A binary is compiled code. When a programmer writes code in a language like C, the C code isn't what gets actually ran. It is compiled into a binary and the binary is run. Binary exploitation is the process of actually exploiting a binary, but what does that mean?

In a lot of code, you will find bugs. Think of a bug as a mistake in code that will allow for unintended functionality. As an attacker we can leverage this bug to attack the binary, and actually force it to do what we want by getting code execution. That means we actually have the binary execute code that we say, and can essentially hack the code.

## Reverse Engineering

What is reverse engineering?

Reverse engineering is the process of figuring out how something works. It is a critical part of binary exploitation, since most of the time you are just handed a binary without any clue as to what it does. You have to figure out how it works, so you can attack it.

## Objective

<<<<<<< HEAD
Most of the time, your objective is to obtain code execution on a box and pop a shell. If you have a different objective, it will usually be stated on the top line of the writeup. In almost every instance where your objective isn't to pop a shell, it's to some get ctf flag associated with this challenge, from the binary.  

## What should I know going into this course?

There are a few areas that will help. If you know how to code, that will help. If you know how to code somewhat low level languages like C, that will help more. Also an understanding of the basics of how to use linux helps a lot. But realistically, the only thing you really need is the ability to google things, and find answers by yourself.

## Why CTF Challenges?

The reason why I went with ctf challenges for teaching binary exploitation / reverse engineering, is because most challenges only contains a small subset of exploitation knowledge. With that I can split it up into different subjects like `buffer overflow into calling shellcode` and `fast bin exploitation`, so it can be covered like a somewhat normal course.

## Environment

For your environment to actually do this work, I would recommend having an Ubuntu VM. However don't let me tell you how to live your life.

## Why Should I do this?

<<<<<<< HEAD
First off, I find it fun (if you don't find this fun, I wouldn't recommend doing this). Plus there are a lot of jobs out there to do this work, with not a lot of people to do the work. Plus who doesn't want to drop that chrome 0 day and watch the world burn?

## Difficulty curve

One thing I want to say, is the difficulty curve in my opinion is like that of a roller coaster that goes up and down. There are certain parts that are easier, and certain parts that are harder. Granted difficulty is relative to the person.

## Update

So, I just tried to update nightmare. It is a bit old, and it's all in python2 which has been deprecated. While trying to update it, it become clear that there are some problems with Nightmare, that it seems that it would be better to just remake the entire thing from scratch. One of the primary problems being, a lot of these challenges require different enviornments to run in. You might have a heap challenge that can only run correctly on Ubuntu 18, while another might only be able to be correctly ran on Ubuntu 16. Having the need to be able to run challenges on so many different (and outdated) enviornment causes a lot of problems. So I will probably be "remaking" this to hopefully solve that, and similar problems.

However, if you are at all interested in the work I did do for the update, you can find that here: https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/new_nightmare/
