input addr is 0xffffd59c and input offset from EBP is 44 
canary addr is 0xffffd5bc and canary offset from EBP is 12
=> canary offset from input is 44-12=32 => how interesting as the minimum size for our input is 32 bytes
=> suggesting a canary bruteforce approach (also because child processes share the same canary as the parent)
